% function M = obliquefactory(n, m, transposed, gpuflag)
%
% Oblique manifold: deals with matrices of size n x m such that each column
% has unit 2-norm, i.e., is a point on the unit sphere in R^n. The metric
% is such that the oblique manifold is a Riemannian submanifold of the
% space of nxm matrices with the usual trace inner product, i.e., the usual
% metric.
%
% If transposed is set to true (it is false by default), then the matrices
% are transposed: a point Y on the manifold is a matrix of size m x n and
% each row has unit 2-norm. It is the same geometry, just a different
% representation.
%
% Set gpuflag = true to have points, tangent vectors and ambient vectors
% stored on the GPU. If so, computations can be done on the GPU directly.

% Change log:
%
%   July 16, 2013 (NB)
%       Added 'transposed' option, mainly for ease of comparison with the
%       elliptope geometry.
%
%   Nov. 29, 2013 (NB)
%       Added normalize_columns function to make it easier to exploit the
%       bsxfun formulation of column normalization, which avoids using for
%       loops and provides performance gains. The exponential still uses a
%       for loop.
%
%   April 4, 2015 (NB)
%       Log function modified to avoid NaN's appearing for close by points.
%
%   April 13, 2015 (NB)
%       Exponential now without for-loops.
%
%   Oct. 8, 2016 (NB)
%       Code for exponential was simplified to only treat the zero vector
%       as a particular case.
%
%   Oct. 21, 2016 (NB)
%       Bug caught in M.log: the function called v = M.proj(x1, x2 - x1),
%       which internally applies transp to inputs and outputs. But since
%       M.log had already taken care of transposing things, this introduced
%       a bug (which only triggered if using M.log in transposed mode.)
%       The code now calls "v = projection(x1, x2 - x1);" since projection
%       assumes the inputs and outputs do not need to be transposed.
%
%   July 20, 2017 (NB)
%       Distance function is now accurate for close-by points. See notes
%       inside the spherefactory file for details. Also improves distance
%       computations as part of the log function.
%
%   Sep. 24, 2023 (NB)
%       Edited bsxfun out, in favor of more modern .* and ./ syntax
%       operating on a matrix and a row/col vector. This is much faster.
%       Also replaced manual computations of the type sqrt(sum(X.^2, 1)) by
%       the built-in call vecnorm(X). That isn't necessarily always faster,
%       but it seems to be reliably close in terms of performance, and a
%       built-in function has a chance to become better in future releases.
%
%   Sep. 24, 2023 (NB)
%       Added GPU support: just set gpuflag = true.
%
%   Sep. 24, 2023 (NB)
%       Added tangent2ambient/tangent2ambient_is_identity pair.
